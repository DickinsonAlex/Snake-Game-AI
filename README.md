# üêç Multi-Agent Snake AI ‚Äì NetLogo
This project explores autonomous agent control in a multi-player Snake game using classical AI search techniques. Each snake operates in a fully observable environment, navigating toward food while avoiding collisions with walls, other snakes, and itself.

‚úÖ Core Features:
- Search-based pathfinding with selectable algorithms for each snake
- Supported algorithms include: Depth-First, Breadth-First, Uniform Cost, Greedy, and A*
- Real-time path execution with one move per tick
- Dropdown menus for assigning specific algorithms to each team

üß† Enhancements:
- 3D Visual Mode: A custom rendering layer that adds a 3D-like perspective to the game grid (Stored on seperate branch)
- Map Selection: Interface for choosing from a set of predefined maps to alter the game environment
